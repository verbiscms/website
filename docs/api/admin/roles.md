# Roles

The `/roles` endpoint is used to retrieve the all roles that a user can be assigned to. This is especially useful for
the `POST` endpoint to create new users, as you can display what roles thew user can be assigned to before creating a
new user.

- `id`: the ID of the role stored in the database.
- `name`: the name of the role.
- `description`: a brief description of the role and the role's permissions.

ðŸ‘‰ `GET` to `/api/{version}/roles`
