## Retrieve a specific User

To retrieve a specific user, an ID parameter is passed after `/users` URL, the following URL will retrieve a user with
an ID of 1.

ðŸ‘‰ `GET` to `/api/{version}/users/1`

## Creating a User

To create a user multiple fields are required as shown below. A `role_id` needs to be attached to the request to assign
the newly created user a role. A response 400 will be returned if the user already exists or validation failed.

Required fields:

- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `email`
- `role_id`
- `password`
- `confirm_password`

Below is a minimal example of creating a user.

ðŸ‘‰ `POST` to `/api/{version}/categories`

```json
{
	"first_name": "Verbis",
	"last_name": "CMS",
	"email": "hello@verbiscms.com",
	"role_id": 2,
	"password": "mypassword",
	"confirm_password": "mypassword"
}
```

## Updating a User

To update a user, an ID parameter is passed after the `/users` URL, the body is exactly the same as the `POST`
route. If no user is found with the given ID, a response of 400 will be returned.

ðŸ‘‰ `PUT` to `/api/{version}/users/1`

```json
{
	"first_name": "CMS"
}
```

## Deleting a User

To delete a user, an ID parameter is passed after the `/users` URL. If no user is found with the given ID a response of
400 will be returned.

ðŸ‘‰ `DELETE` to `/api/{version}/users/1`
